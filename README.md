# Batako

> ### Todo:
> * Handle mouse and keyboard input. I think it would be nice to support both events and polling but I don't know if that's realistic.
> * Make a drawable that can be edited at runtime. I'm thinking the user fills in pixels in a grid to create your own tetris-style block.
> * Add some form of importing. I'm thinking either FBX or  glTF.
